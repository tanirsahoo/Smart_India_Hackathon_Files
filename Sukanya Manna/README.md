# TO-DO List
Python program for user grouping
Application whitelisting

Files can be encrypted using crytography.Fernet(uses AES) 'stable'
penetrable only through brute force

os.listdir - for all files in directory
Terminal - directory zipping and encryption in-built in linux

Level wise Encryption can be done using different algorithms
Triple DES(three keys 56 bit)
AES
Rsa (2) (time factor)
Blowfish (fast)
Twofish (fast)


# GUI Design Issues

1. Assumption: Already installed RDP()
2. Intial Entry Page non-existent
3. Border-Around Policy Existent
4. Scan::(For prototype) && only roots can do it which must be updated
5. Many user, how to show(view available user not confirmed by DT)
6. click --> enable|disable
7. file encryption to be implement later on specific user file creaion policies
8. back options must be incorporated
