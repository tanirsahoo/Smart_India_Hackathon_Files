Firewall Functions

1. Network Security: Firewalls act as a barrier between your server and the external network (typically the internet). They filter incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect your server from unauthorized access, malicious attacks, and potential security threats.

2. Access Control: Firewalls allow you to control which network services and ports are accessible from the network. By defining rules, you can specify who can connect to your server and what services they can access. This ensures that only authorized traffic reaches your server.

3. Port Filtering: You can use a firewall to open or close specific ports on your server. For example, you can open ports for services like SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, or specific applications. Closing unnecessary ports reduces the attack surface and enhances security.

4. Packet Filtering: Firewalls can filter packets (data packets) based on various criteria such as source IP addresses, destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols. This allows you to permit or deny traffic based on these attributes.

5. Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Some advanced firewalls include intrusion detection and prevention features (IDS/IPS) that can detect and block suspicious or malicious network traffic patterns, helping to safeguard your server against attacks.

6. Protection from DDoS Attacks: Firewalls can mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by filtering out traffic from known malicious sources or sources sending an unusually high volume of requests.

7. Logging and Auditing: Firewalls often log network activity, which is essential for monitoring and auditing purposes. These logs can be analyzed to identify potential security incidents or policy violations.

8. Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support: Firewalls can facilitate the creation and management of VPN connections, allowing secure remote access to your server.

9. DMZ Configuration: Firewalls can be used to set up a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to segregate public-facing services from internal resources, adding an additional layer of security.

10. Application Layer Filtering: Some firewalls can inspect traffic at the application layer (Layer 7 of the OSI model) and make decisions based on specific applications or services, providing granular control.
